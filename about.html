    <h1>Hello, my name is Raden Rafitamma. I am a design student currently enrolling in Visual Communication Design studies. I mainly have experience in graphic design and photography—having done a few photos as a side-hobby. 
        <br>
        <br> My graphics are mainly on the digital side of things—with minor photo editing and coloring. I experiment often, and try to incorporate emotion into the work, letting it guide the general idea, commanding the visual output—allowing me to explore many kinds of visual outputs, rather than a select visual style. 
        <br>
        <br> Despite the emotional weight, I try to keep a playful tone to my work.</h1>
